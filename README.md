## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a great project for React and styled-components.  I leverage many of the lessons learned from the 'REST Countries API' project, but I feel more confidence in the used of React hooks and styled-components' ThemeProvider.  I am really enjoying how React hooks can be used to manage state with useState and useContext instead of 'prop drilling'.  Likewise, I feel the file structure allows for more reusable and manageable code.

### Continued development

I am going to continue creating React applications to gain more confident and speed.
